Globally, cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, continue to be a major cause of mortality. Medical data analysis faces the challenging task of predicting the onset of cardiac illness. The use of machine learning algorithms in medical data analysis can aid healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely decisions in terms of diagnosis and treatment. By analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns, machine learning (ML) algorithms can help identify important features that are crucial for identifying cardiac disease. The use of six different ML classifiers in the study demonstrates the versatility of machine learning in predicting heart disease. By using multiple classification techniques and feature pairs, the prediction model can be optimized to accurately identify the disease in patients.Â 

Heart disease comprises a variety of conditions that affect the heart and the circulatory system responsible for distributing blood throughout the body. The World Health Organization reports that cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke, are responsible for the highest number of deaths worldwide, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually. Strokes and heart attacks are also frequently associated with cardiovascular disease, accounting for four out of every five cardiovascular disease fatalities. Cardiovascular diseases include coronary heart disease, rheumatic fever with carditis, and failure of heart, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Shockingly, one-third of all fatalities involve people under the age of 70.

Heart disease can be influenced by several determinants, such as gender, smoking habits, life stage, family history, poor dietary choices, and high cholesterol levels, lack of physical activity, obesity, hypertension, and excessive alcohol consumption. Genetic factors, such as hyperglycemia and hypertension, can also elevate the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease.
